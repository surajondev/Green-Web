            <p class="p-container">Renewable energy is useful energy that is collected from renewable resources, which are 
                naturally replenished on a human timescale, including carbon neutral sources like sunlight, 
                wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. The term often also encompasses biomass as
                well, whose carbon neutral status is under debate. This type of energy source 
                stands in contrast to fossil fuels, which are being used far more quickly than they 
                are being replenished.</p>

            <p class="p-container">Web hosting providers consume a great amount of energy to power servers and data centre for 
                providing 24/7 services. Other related facilities such as cooling controls and enhanced security setups also 
                require a lot of electricity. Such a great amount of energy usage has a negative impact on the environment. 
                Green web hosting, as the name implied, is the web hosting solution powered by environmental friendly resources 
                such as renewable energy.</p>

            <p class="p-container">Renewable energy is generated through natural resources. It is naturally 're-usable'. 
                Hydroelectricity and wind power are often the most common natural resources. In North America, electricity 
                is mostly generated by renewable energy. For example, according to Wikipedia, "Canada is the world's second 
                largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and one of few countries to generate the majority of its 
                electricity from hydroelectricity (59% in 2006)". In daily operations, a handful web hosting firms start taking 
                proactive solutions such as using more efficient server hardware to reduce the electricity usage. All of these 
                practices become very common in North American web hosting industry.</p>
